Blogo
=====

Blogo is a Lotus Domino-based open source blogging tool launched in 2008. Although it may be dated by today's standards, you are free to use it in any way you see fit. Support is minimal at this point, you will have to help yourself using the included .nsf file and the manual (in PDF).
